"a creative, playful lifestyle creates memorable experiences that will last a lifetime"

\-Tate Busch, 2019

Hi, my name is Tate Busch, aspiring UX designer and future UX influencer. I am a creative individual highly interested in cars and technology. I am especially interested in designing user experiences for "wearable interactive technology" such as google glass or other augmented reality wearables. I believe augmented reality is the future of technology. this technology could be used to create a pair of glasses that overlays a heads up display over your vision. Designing this display interests me. This augmented reality user interface display would basically include your entire phone into one augmented reality device, with functionality that includes: access to social media, access to browsers, access to communication services (phone and text) and access to work (a virtual keyboard).

The more you get to know me the more you will understand my passion for cars. Cars have been my favourite hobby and I have made it my life goal to own a collection of my favourite cars. I have been significantly inspired to work hard  by my dream of owning exotic cars. I have made it my biggest life goal to one day be the proud owner of my favourite car, a Lamborghini Aventador SV. I have seriously considered combining my favourite hobby and my career. I have thought about how to integrate UX into automobile design and have decided it is a crucial part of designing a car because a car is so much more than something that gets you from point A to B, it is an experience. The future of cars will be influenced by advancements in driverless AI technology augmented reality. 

Designing to ensure the user of a car has a memorable experience with the car that gives the a positive experience will be important. I can design how users interact with AI, how the pass the time in the cabin of their self driving car and designing the aesthetics of both the interior and exterior of the car because to most buyers this is extremely important. Designing for the senses such as sound and feel will also be important as cars transition from gas to electric. I believe cars should be designed with "fun" in mind because that will help users create a memorable experience that will leave them with positive image of the company and increase the odds that they will become repeat customers. 

What does UX mean to me?

UX is a broad skillset that enables me to understand how to Ideate, Prototype and test meaningful designs that will create an impact on the world.

applying the UX skills that I learn with my time at Laurier to one of my interests is very important to me because it helps me build empathy with my designs. It is important because it will inspire me to be \*that\* much more committed to ensuring that whatever I design is of as high quality as it can be. 

from my point of view as a User Experience Designer, A product is much more than just a physical item, it is the whole experience the user deals with. there are several factors that influence a users perception of a product such as: Experience, interactivity, aesthetics, community, prestige and innovation. i would enjoy applying these factors into the designing of a
