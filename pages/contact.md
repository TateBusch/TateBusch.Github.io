## Illustrator In My Free Time

 I have completed several UX related projects both on my own time and through my school. I decided that it would be best to showcase the projects that best reflect me so that whomever is viewing this may get a good understanding of who I am without ever even meeting me. Let's start with a series of projects that I completed on my own just for fun. I decided to apply my design and Adobe Illustrator skills to one of my hobbies; cars and car design. I began by tracing photos of the cars I liked to help inspire my creativity to design my own cars.

 The first car I traced was a new Toyota Supra concept car. I traced the car in about 20 min and was happy with my first drawing so I decided to continue and find more cars to draw. the next choice was obvious to me, it was going to be a Lamborghini. I was able to trace this car with much better success. The drawing was more clear and precise while simultaneously drawing it was faster than my first attempt.

 After tracing existing cars I decided to begin designing my own. I drew a couple quick ideas and then decided that I would design a Lamborghini-inspired car. The car I created did not turn out exactly how I envisioned but i was able to still mostly capture my idea. In my drawing I was inspired by different periods in car design that I liked such as the pop up headlights of the late 80s-90s aswell as the inclusion of futuristic gullwing doors. I plan on drawing more angles of this car with better accuracy to better envision my design. I also will be designing several car interiors in the near future.

## Website Prototyping:

I was organizing the work I completed over the past year and a half at Laurier and came across this UX-process built website from my first year. It was an assignment assigned in my UX103 - UX strategy class. I also had an idea on how I could change to improve the original website idea but will discuss it after i talk about the project.

The assignment was designed to test our user research skills. We were tasked with conducting secondary then primary research to create a product prototype (such as a low fidelity website or an app wireframe). A case study was then completed at the end to showcase the research that I compiled. Before I began i started with an idea: how can UX be applied to the future of cars along with how will self driving cars change how cars are designed. 

During my secondary research I spent my time researching existing companies that spend a lot of money and time in research and development of driverless AI technology. The companies I researched included Tesla and Waymo(Google). I wanted to gather the most up to date information on the factors that sway peoples decision when purchasing a car so I decided to conducted my own research. I conducted user research into what people want out of a car by having interviews with car buyers of varying demographics and by having potential users complete both open and closed card sorts about the most important factors to consider when purchasing a car. 

After completing my research I was almost able to begin working on usable prototypes. But before I began I had to first lay out all the aspects of a well designed website aswell as what key features needs to be included in my product. I started off with a rough wireframe that I drew on paper then refined it into another paper prototype that could be user tested. I tested my prototype with my users again and observed them use it to see where they struggled and asked them for feedback and comments. I then created my first website wireframe using a website builder. A few more iterations later and I had a prototype with an easy to navigate layout and successfully displays the main ideas that were planned on being included. I conducted usability research after completing each iteration of my website.

**(2019) 2nd year idea update:** 

When revisiting my UX103 assignment from last year, ideas on how to improve it flooded my mind. If I were to do this project again I would change my idea and build a different project but take the same steps to complete it. The website could be an all inclusive UXDesigner platform. it would combine a library of user research (behind a pay wall) with a business oriented social media platform UX designers. The website would also include job listings for companies looking to hire UX designers; simultaneously attracting people looking to get a UX design job. Another section of the website could also include a education section that can have paid for classes that teach someone how to become a ux designer. The classes would teach by invoking creativity while simultaneously teaching students all the tools they need to bring to life any idea from their imagination to life through programs such as illustrator swell as skills taught to them that allow them to prototype and expand upon their ideas through several product iterations. The education section would also teach the designers how to test their product in a real life scenario by conducting primary research. Primary research is conducted using interviews, surveys, usability testing and card sorting.

## Poster Design:

In my program we have a graphic design class that teaches us different programs to help us as designers. The programs we learn are very useful to me as a User Experience Designer because they are the tools that enable me to transfer my creative design ideas from my thoughts and allows me to view them in real life. I work on my design skills on my own time because they are what limit my creativity. Improving my design skills with the adobe suite will help me to show off my ideas at their highest potential allowing others to have an easier time seeing the quality of my idea. Adobe Illustrator is my favourite program because I was never a good drawer with a pencil but a computer helps enable me to communicate my ideas with a higher quality.

To test my design skills in my graphic design class, I was tasked with designing a poster to best represent the UX program. I began by ideating my design and created some quick sketches to help start getting the layout of my poster set out. I created a few iterations and changed my poster more and more as more ideas came to me until I was able to end up at my final product. My final product is designed for high students to get thinking about the different aspects that make up UX. I also emphasized it being offered at Wilfrid Laurier University to encourage students to apply to the school.

## Group Maker Project:

Maker lab is a class that is designed to inspire creativity and to help teach us UX designers the importance of "thinking outside the box" and considering all possible ideas. Maker lab also teaches us about ethics; a very important part of UX in todays society. Another important aspect of this class is allowing people to work together to share and critique each others ideas helping us improve our collaboration skills. The projects we had to complete was broken down into two different parts known as group maker project 1 and 2 (nicknamed GMP). 

The first GMP project we were only given instructions to "reinvent a box" to allow us to design freely and be creative. We came up with a multipurpose modular storage solution with an emphasis on holding multiple types of pets such as fish and a guinea pig.
