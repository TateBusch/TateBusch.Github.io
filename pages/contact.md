## Illustrator In My Free Time

 I have completed several UX related projects both on my own time and through my school. I decided that it would be best to showcase the projects that best reflect me so that you may get a good understanding of who I am without ever even meeting me. Let's start with a series of projects that I completed on my own just for fun. I decided to apply my design and Adobe Illustrator skills to one of my hobbies; cars and car design. I began by tracing photos of the cars I liked to help inspire my creativity to design my own cars.

 The first car I traced was a new Toyota Supra concept car. I traced the car in about 20 min and was happy with my first drawing so I decided to continue and find more cars to draw. the next choice was obvious to me, it was going to be a Lamborghini. I was able to trace this car with much better success. The drawing was more clear and precise while simultaneously drawing it was faster than my first attempt.

 After tracing existing cars I decided to begin designing my own. I drew a couple quick ideas and then decided that I would design a Lamborghini-inspired car. The car I created did not turn out exactly how I envisioned but i was able to still mostly capture my idea. In my drawing I was inspired by different periods in car design that I liked such as the pop up headlights of the late 80s-90s aswell as the inclusion of futuristic gullwing doors. I plan on drawing more angles of this car with better accuracy to better envision my design. I also will be designing several car interiors in the near future.

## Website Prototyping:

I was organizing the work I completed over the past year and a half at Laurier and came across this UX-process built website from my first year. It was an assignment assigned in my UX103 - UX strategy class. I had this idea on how I could change the original website to be better:

2019 2nd year idea update: 

The website could be an all inclusive UXDesigner platform. it would combine a library of user research (behind a pay wall) with a business oriented social media platform UX designers. The website would also include job listings for companies looking to hire UX designers; simultaneously attracting people looking to get a UX design job. Another section of the website could also include a education section that can have paid for classes that teach someone how to become a ux designer. The classes would teach by invoking creativity while simultaneously teaching students all the tools they need to bring to life any idea from their imagination to life through programs such as illustrator swell as skills taught to them that allow them to prototype and expand upon their ideas through several product iterations. The education section would also teach the designers how to test their product in a real life scenario by conducting primary research. Primary research is conducted using interviews, surveys, usability testing and card sorting.

## Poster Design: 

In my graphic design class we were tasked with designing a poster to represent the UX program.
