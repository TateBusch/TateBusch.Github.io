 I have completed several Projects both on my own time and through my school. Let's start with a series of projects that I completed on my own just for fun. I decided to apply my design and Adobe Illustrator skills to one of my hobbies; Cars and car design. I began by tracing photos of the cars I liked to help inspire my creativity to design my own cars.

 The first car I traced was a new Toyota Supra concept car. I traced the car in about 20 min and was happy with my first drawing so I decided to continue and find more cars to draw. the next choice was obvious to me, it was going to be a Lamborghini. I was able to trace this car with much better success. The drawing was more clear and precise while simultaneously drawing it was faster than my first attempt.

 After tracing existing cars I decided to begin designing my own. I drew a couple quick ideas and then decided that I would design a Lamborghini-inspired car. The car I created did not turn out exactly how I envisioned but i was able to still mostly capture my idea. In my drawing I was inspired by different periods in car design that I liked such as the pop up headlights of the late 80s-90s aswell as the inclusion of futuristic gullwing doors. I plan on drawing more angles of this car with better accuracy to better envision my design. I also will be designing several car interiors in the near future.
